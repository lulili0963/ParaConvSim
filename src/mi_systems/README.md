## Mixed-initiative conversational search systems

Each system is composed of the following, controlled by the flags in the main.py:

- Retrieval module
- Clarification need prediction -- whether to ask a clarifying question or not
- Clarifying question generator or selector
- Answer processing module -- how to process the answer to the question
- Additional retrieval (can be the same as the first retrieval)
