# ParaConvSim
Code for the SIGIR-AP 2024 paper "Simulating Conversational Search Users with Parameterized Behavior".


![system](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16a4c961-a859-4173-b8ce-c24f55db46c2)

We propose ParaConvSim to simulate users with three different behavior traits: Patience, Cooperativeness and Politeness, achieving personalized feedback. 
Then, we evaluate the retrieval performance on TREC CAsT Year4 from [1].

Note: the framework of the pipeline is from SIGIR 2023 paper "Exploiting Simulated User Feedback for Conversational Search: Ranking, Rewriting, and Beyond".
